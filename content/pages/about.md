Title: About

# Hi, my name is Ryan Sadwick.

  - Started working on development of ecommerce and video software

There came a point in my life where the life where I was surrounded by dead ends.  I realized that this culture leads
us down a path that breaks us but never builds us back up.  It leads us into debt with no relief.

Being a follower of Christ and servant to my church changed the way I live - I'm never going back.  The blessing and storms
I've received has molded me into the Christian Warrior I am today: **Through it all**, my eyes are on You.

> Don't copy the behavior and customs of this world,
> but let God transform you into a new person by changing
> the way you think.
> Then you will know what God wants you to do, and you
> will know how good and pleasing and perfect His will really is.

*Romans 12:2*
